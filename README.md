# Cindral Drafter

An original Rust 3D modeling application with inference-driven drawing and push/pull modeling. Cindral Drafter uses its own UI and versioned `.cdraft` format. No third-party modeling application code, assets, branding, or file-format SDKs are used.

## Development

Install stable Rust, then run:

```sh
cargo fmt --all --check
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test --workspace
```

See [architecture](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) and [agent log](docs/AGENT_LOG.md).
